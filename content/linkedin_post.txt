🚨 Cybersecurity Alert: Are Your Employees Your Biggest Security Risk? 🚨

In 2023, insider threats accounted for 20% of all data breaches, costing organizations an average of $4.7 million per incident. The scariest part? Most companies don't even know they're vulnerable.

I'm excited to share about an innovative open-source solution that's revolutionizing workforce security: the Workforce Monitoring and Insider Risk Management Agent.

🔍 What makes this different?

✅ **AI-Powered Behavioral Analysis**: Uses GPT-4 and Claude to understand CONTEXT behind user actions - not just what they do, but WHY they do it

✅ **Real-Time DLP**: Advanced data loss prevention with eBPF network monitoring to catch threats before they leave your network

✅ **Enterprise-Grade Architecture**: C++ core for performance, Python backend for intelligence, web dashboard for visibility

✅ **Privacy-First Design**: Compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and other regulations while providing comprehensive security

The key insight? Traditional monitoring tools give you logs. This gives you INTELLIGENCE.

Imagine detecting:
- Unusual file access patterns outside business hours
- Suspicious data transfers to unauthorized destinations
- Behavioral changes indicating potential insider threats
- Productivity anomalies that might signal security risks

All analyzed by AI that learns and adapts to your organization's patterns.

This isn't about spying on employees. It's about protecting your business from the threats you can't see.
